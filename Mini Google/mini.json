I live to breathe another day in anticipation of Trey Parkers next installment, whether it be South Park or some other venture. South Park is truly the work of a genius. Thank you, Sir Parker. (In Britian they often \"knight\" certian individuals (usually after they are \"old\" or \"dead\") for their contributions to their society) :)Sometimes it is dry. Sometimes it is wet. And sometimes it is too moist for humor. But somebody has to do it!I would like to see new South Park episodes until the day I leave this mortal existence. However, I know that Sir Parker would want to \"move on\". However, I would much like to see South Park from the eyes of a 90 year old Trey Parker. What wisdom would we see then?....",

Very bright, colorful animation that makes everything look very nice.  A wide variety of creative characters each with their own special personality and goofy problems.  Solid storytelling that makes the characters more interesting, and a very wild adult sense of humor that has *so* much creativity you can barely keep up with the constant jumping around.

    "reviewText": "People who like cartoons must be thankful for DVDs, because that technology opened up the floodgates for fans for every kind of animation. Whether you like classic Looney Tunes, hippy-dippy sci-fi parables or Asian tentacle porn, its all there for you to find and enjoy. Its only been in the last 20 years or so, however, that American TV networks have clued into the idea that many adults like cartoons that have content specifically aimed at adults, even though some cartoons did well in prime-time even fifty years ago or so. Now, with DVD, you can not only watch entire seasons at a shot, you can also see the shows in their unadulterated glory.Which brings us to the Comedy Central series Drawn Together. Ive been a fan of this show for a while, partly because of the writing and partly because of the cheerful way in which it steamrolls political correctness and good taste. If South Park is the Mount Everest of crude, crass animation, then Drawn Together is K2; it doesnt stand as tall, but its a tougher climb. The truth of this was brought home upon watching the second season of the show on DVD. Much to my surprise, watching the DVD turned out to be a different experience than watching it in first run.Part of this is due to one of the DVD sets selling points: its unexpurgated. I didnt think this would make much of a difference, as its generally pretty clear whats been cut. As it turns out, there was a lot cut out of the show, and not just language: genitalia, violence, enough racist abuse to make the KKK turn red under their sheets, sex in a vast array of configurations and a whole lot of other content that probably produces instant pucker in the unfortunate souls who work in Comedy Centrals Standards and Practices department. Now, Im not one for censorship, but the additional material works against the show to a certain degree. Whats there is still funny in multiple senses, from satire to slapstick, but actually being able to hit the money words (and shots) dilutes the humor a bit.As far as taste goes, DT is not a show to start novices on. If adult animation is still a new concept for you, and you think The Simpsons is bleeding-edge in the sometimes fluid space between being socially acceptable and being a pariah, then DT may cause seizures. For people who like edgy animation, this will be just the ticket. The voiceover artists and writers take their material seriously, and theyre willing to go wherever the jokes take them (the season finale has a running gag with historical dates and the episodes connected to them that manages to be both subtle and sick).In terms of presentation, the DT set is relatively bare-bones. The whole season of 15 episodes is crammed onto two discs, leaving just enough room for a handful of interviews with the voiceover artists (minus Adam Carolla, who has plenty to do outside the show) and a karaoke singalong. The visual quality is pretty sharp, and the sound quality is good, but this isnt the kind of material you use to do any THX certifications with, so its not like youd expect much. Still, its the episodes that matter, and for you sick little monkeys out there who like this kind of thing, Drawn Together season 2 is a worthwhile expenditure. Just dont leave it out where Grandma or the kids might get a hold of it. Either youll scar them for life (maybe shuffling Granny into an early grave), or youll never get it back.",

Those who arent into extremely crude humor wont be as entertained, though.This season picks up with the previouss cliffhanger of the plane crash, then quickly tries to top the previous season. It pokes fun at the shows & characters that its based on as well as making jabs at its critics. The DVD set is uncensored, which is nice but some of the jokes lose a bit of their punch.

The season begins where the first one left off, with the house mates crash landing and eventually getting back to the house for plenty of animated insanity.  The visual gags are still quite funny, but the shows constant bombardment of homophobic jokes (especially with Captain Hero, which gets real boring and tired) and toilet humor without any kind of substance goes from hysterical to boring and contrived.  Granted we see the same kind of treatment on South Park, but with that show theres always an underlining hint of social commentary at the very least.  You wont find much of that here with Drawn Together, but then again, the show never really attempts to do such a thing either.  All that being said, theres still plenty to admire with the second season of Drawn Together, but its nowhere near as funny as the first season was either.  All in all though, if you enjoy the show for what its worth despite its flaws, this DVD set is definitely worth picking up regardless.",

But DT pushes the limit even further, nesting in that dirty area where even the other three wont go.The only limit to that strategy is that DT is burning the candle by the two ends, and hadnt the show been cancelled at the end of the third season, theyd probably have run out of taboos to break, anyway, after 4 to 5 years.But lets salute the effort and appreciate the freedom of speech of the show, even if half of this libertys wasted on filthy, disgusting, low-level jokes. The other half is just worth the buy!",

While I dont know how many of the \"mysteries\" are \"mysteries\" because to me as a Methodist Christian it appears that God has clearly stated what He means in the Bible by most of these \"mysteries,\" but other topics that are explored that God seems to be silent about in the Bible are fascinating to learn about via the professors and archaelogists that are in this dynamic series on the Bible. Do I agree with everything the scholars say about the Bible and some of the mysteries that are explored in this great series? Definitely no! However, if you love the Bible as much as I do as well as have an interest in knowledge; especially, biblical questions and mysteries, then this series is definitely worth buying! I havent bought this dvd collection, yet, but I have rented the dvds and seen the tv series when it used to air on tv and its a great DVD collection to add to your already pre-existing dvd collection! The price is affordable and well worth it! For the knowledge alone, Im surprised that it doesnt cost well over $100 for this entire series!

Not content with the biblical accounts of these now historical figures this video series seeks to deconstruct them by projecting on them present-day academic political and philosophical \"theories behind the legendary figures and fabled stories of the Bible.\" If this one part of series utilizes this approach it is likely it is shared with the rest of the series. \"Twenty-two full-length programs from the acclaimed A&E series MYSTERIES OF THE BIBLE are featured in this collection providing a wealth of astonishing discoveries and unforgettable revelations.\" Unfortunately, the only \"unforgettable\" aspect of this series is that it is long on theory and short on facts.",

The set is getting dated - going back to the mid-90s, but not much has changed dramatically in the field of Biblical Archeology - which is largely the premise.  The narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons is pretty good, though cal lull you to sleep with the dulet tones.  The content is good as well, with interview of scholars, archaeologists, religious, and others who interweave the various components together to explore some of the Bibles unanswered and unanswerable questions. The integration of Jewish and Christian thought is well done, and I believe that either Christian or Jew will find this set entertaining and enlightening.

Okay, so the 22 episodes offered here are all interesting and informative. What I liked best about the series is that they are going on the premise that everything in the Bible is to be looked at as fact. However, the series does offer the opinions of scholars that sometimes suggest otherwise and they pose some interesting facts and questions that do not always line up with archeological finds. When asked for their opinions, scholars will offer beliefs that do not always line up with most dogmatic ways of thinking, In other words, I understood this series to be unbiased and presented the facts fairly and allowed different opinions to be heard. Many of them which surprisingly do support many held beliefs we have all been taught.When I first bought this series a few years ago, I watched it but really couldnt appreciate it. Now that I am actively involved in religious education, I see this series in a whole different light. It has the basic information for beginners, but also has many surprising facts that I still didnt know after many years of hard religious studies.

You will find yourself rooting for the pair in every episode leading up to the finale.Innocent touches, shy glances, head tilts, and flirting, make Season 1 the best of the series.Oh yeah. Theres the token bitchy cheerleader, Madison, to stir up some drama for the should-be/might-be/could-be couple. The adopted black brother to teach us about racial identity. An overbearing mother. A shirtless boy to keep the straight audience happy. And a father any teenage girl would be envious to have.But when all is said and done, this show is entirely about Spencer and Ashley.It is too good to be cancelled before its time.

I want to secure everybody that wants to buy it by saying that on dvd, blu-ray and on a computer, everything is working perfectly, I tried it. Moreover, some wanted to know if there were any extras in the dvds such has interviews, deleted scenes or bloopers and there is none (sorry), only the episodes. However, now, for the appreciation part of the serie, I would definetly recommend South of Nowhere to teenagers who like romantic/drama series. Even though your not gay, you can fully appreciate this tv show for its originality, its funny parts and its themes such has love, teenage \"problems\" (first time, moving in a new city, fitting in, the need to belong somewere, ennemies, etc.). And for the girls that are gay, well, you will appreciate this story because of all the reasons above and because it shows, trough Spencers story, all the steps that someone goes trough when they gradually find out their true sexuality and how they live their first real love. Furthermore, I have to say this, Ashley (Mandy Musgrave)and Spencer (Gabrielle Christian)are really gorgeous and they form a beautiful couple. S.O.N. is amazing!",

    "reviewText": "I was very pleased with my recent purchase of season one of south of nowhere on DVD. I had read some bad things about this set but I bought it anyway, I was a big fan of the show back then and I just wanted to be able to watch it again. I wanted to buy all 3 seasons but that would have been pretty expensive. lol I do plan to buy the other two later. But as some have already stated, the theme music is different. I didnt like it at first but after you watch it all the way through you dont mind the theme music, its just strange to me that they changed it...? this is a great gift for anyone you may know struggling with their sexuality. it got me through some tough times with my own when it was on television and now I can sit back and watch Spencers plight knowing what shes gone through already firsthand. The set is only 3 DVDs long its a very short season, thats why its so cheap compared to season 2 & 3 but I recommend it to anyone. I really wish everyone would watch the whole season I think it would change some views of a lot of closed-minded people. All three seasons of the show depict a young girl struggling to balance between making her mother, a religious woman with strong opinions, happy and letting herself be who she is finding out she is. Her father, a guidance counselor of sorts, just wants her to be happy but hes got his own problems. The story also centers on her two brothers, one adopted and looking for his birth mother, and one blood brother who is trying to be a basketball star and runs into complications along the way. Ashley and Spencer are adorable together and this is, above all, a love story for the next generation. The set itself is no fuss no muss, comes with just the box and 3 DVDs, conservatively decorated, but its what is inside that counts, which is hours of enjoyment that will make you go \"awww!\" and have you smiling to yourself. I would give this whole series as a gift to anyone and everyone if it werent so expensive I think everyone should watch it its both entertaining and helpful in understanding the plight of lesbian and bisexual people. Ashley never says shes a lesbian (that I remember. at least not in this season) and sometimes she plays around with aiden but in the end we know shes not into men. Spencer is \"not into labels\" and I love her for that so we never know whether to classify either of them as \"bi\" or \"gay\" as spencer called it, but I can pretty safely say  this is a show about girls, for girls, of any orientation. Its compelling and full of sweet moments anyone could enjoy.",

This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs.

Ive seen pieces of Woody Manns DVD on Blind Blake, and as an instructor, he appears to know how to communicate with someone who is trying to learn.  In other words, his demonstrations are slow (but still in rhythmic time), and his explanations are meticulous and succinct.However, Amazons Unbox download is lacking a pdf tablature to supliment the video download.  This could be detramental to people who want to learn the styles Mann teaches (Lonnie Johnson, Memphis Minnie, etc...) but do not have the musical vocabulary, or have not yet been introduced to it.My suggestion to the buyer is if you get stuck, find some mp3s & online tabs of these artists works, learn their phrases and then come back to this video for Woody Mann to help explain the thinking / theory behind these individual styles.  Because I know if I had not already learned one or two songs from these artists, along with some basic fretboard theory, I wouldnt know where to begin with this $14 purchase.Or just dont buy this video.  Spend the few extra bucks on the physical dvd and booklet.  Whatever works for you.(Note to Amazon:  The three stars is based on Amazons poor judgement to not include pdf tabs.

Now they have added those episodes back in (and increased the price) so my major objection is over.On the merit of the series itself, this is quite a steal.  This has to be one of the all-time best Anime series, especially for those who like a darker, edgier anime.  This is pure young character drama here, at its best.  There are mecha in this series (well, one), but it plays an extremely minor role and mecha fans should not get this series on that alone (get it because its awesome!).  I really cant recommend this story enough.If Amazon would let me change my star rating, I would. (originally rated at 1-star for missing episodes).  I would give it a 3 star (5 for story, but its only available on Unbox dubbed, no subtitled version).Let me restate that.  This is the dubbed version of the anime, not the subtitled version.

Ive poured concrete professionally for 15 years and I thought it would be interesting to watch someone elses technique. I feel that a sidewalk could be a do-it-yourself type of job, IF you have the motivation. but if you plan on pouring a 16 x 22 drive way (especially in the summer) you MUST have someone helping you who knows about concrete. the air temperature, humidity, slump and wind all have a strong bearing on how the concrete will dry. Ready mix yards may suggest a retarder for adverse drying conditions but you really do need to know what you are doing. The timing of when to start finishing the concrete is never the same twice, so maybe the 10 min. limit he suggested is ok or maybe not. If you fresno the surface before its ready and the bleed water can come up you will seal it and this can result in blistering, peeling and dusting of the surface which will greatly reduce the life of your concrete. I would suggest reading the ACI (ASCC1). You only get 1 shot to do it right and concrete is hard within 90 minutes of leaving the mix plant so be careful.",

The acting is quite solid, and I am glad to see the show has been able to retain two of the shows secondary characters; while playing back-up and fill-in roles to the two main actors, they add to the overall excellence.  The episodes for Season Five are all quite well written, with some interesting plot twists and red herrings for those who are trying to figure out \"who done it.\"  For American fans, it is interesting to see how the \"Amber Alert\" system is set up in Bradfield, the location for the series, in \"The Color of Amber\"; I did find the writing in this one episode to be at times a bit too convoluted with a few too many side stories going on.  Americans will also be interested in seeing the significant differences in policing and the widespread use of closeed-circuit TV cameras in public places that oftentimes provides crucial evidence or clues.  My only complaint is that there are only a few episodes released each season (although they are nearly 90 minutes long a piece).  We want more Wire in the Blood!",

As another reviewer stated, he has perfected the role, ([bleeding heart psychiatrist]), who seems less afraid, but rather enchanted, with the illnesses of his patients. He empathizes with how they got the way they are instead of despising them for how they evolved from their molding circumstances. Without condescention, he faces the bad (the killer), and the good (the police and innocent victims), without judging either. That could make him appear apathetic, or stoic, but doesnt because of the way he has a grip on the role he plays (compassionate!). I have all of the captioned above and hope the rumors arent true that this is the last of WIRE....But if it is, Ill be looking forward to whatever he does next!",

Their relationship crosses from the strictly professional to the personal-not as a couple-but as two human beings with personal issues who cant help but to yield to our need to connect to those closer to us.  The episodes are gripping, any case involving children are nerve wrecking and potentially heart breaking, the third episode has an unexpected end and the last one is frightening for its possibilities, so all the episodes are very intense. Tonys knowledge of human nature is fascinating-rarely found such remarkable writing. Beautifully shot.  Love the Smart Board and Kevin and Paulas very casual attire.",

The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows dont get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  Its just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.",

    "reviewText": "Ive been a sort of halfhearted fan of this series since season one, but season five finally won me over completely. The stories are especially compelling and original this time, and less \"demented\" (despite the quote on the box!) than previous seasons. Each episode is written, produced, and directed in an entirely different style, e.g., the first one is fast-paced, with the camera never alighting for more than a few seconds, while the second one is very grainy, jumpy, and almost completely colorless; the last episode is a bit over saturated with color, giving it a sort of surreal look. This is somewhat daring, but it works extremely well.Another strength of this season is the character of Alex. I really liked Carol, but Alex is at least as compelling, if not more so. Also Kevin and Paula, as the \"minor\" characters, are superbly well written and well acted.And then theres Tony, who is my \"small exception.\" Hes as charming and likeable as ever, if not more so, and seems to have become a bit more compassionate and considerate of other people. (I was thoroughly charmed by the popcorn-with-Ben scene!) But a little of his eccentricity is gone. We dont really see just how much of a complete oddball he is. However, they more than made up for it in \"Prayer of the Bone\" so I cant really even call it a flaw.If you like a truly suspenseful, intelligent, multi-layered drama, but previous episodes have left you uncertain about watching this series, give season five a try.",

Production values, acting, narrative, all add to the seriess early development and to the growth of the ensemble characters, particularly Hermione Norriss (then) DI Carol Jordan and of course Robson Greens portrayal of Tony Hill. As with all of the series, though, all of the core characters gain some detail. The cinematography deserves some notice, as well, particularly as this DP, Dominic Clemence, avoids the hand-held excesses that crop up and intrude with some later DPs. The visual element, combination of scenic with close work, contribute a great deal to the specific story, but also add to a continued sense of mood and atmosphere.

    "reviewText": "\"Wire in the Blood, Season 5,\" is the latest installment of the British television mystery serial, based on the works of Val McDermid, to reach these shores.  The series, a police procedural that stars Robson Green as psychologist Dr. Tony Hill, criminal profiler, is produced by Greens production company for the British Granada TV: hes one of their biggest domestic stars; and the series is surely tailored to his many strengths.  It has been shown here on BBC America; but it is lacking the last episode of the series as shown here, which has been spun off as a standalone.In addition to Green, the series stars longtime regulars Mark Letheren as Detective Sergeant Kevin Geoffries, and Emma Handy as Detective Constable Paula McIntyre.  Simone Lahbib continues her more recent duties as Detective Inspector Alex Fielding, Hills foil, romantic and otherwise.  This season, as most, is simply advertised as \"based on characters created by\" McDermid, and there is not a single episode based on one of her books. However, the episodes presented are of a fairly high quality, solid mysteries, with some of the well-known authors intensity; some of her edginess and grit, and her ability to break new ground.  McDermid, of course, is a leading light of the British mystery writing school known as tartan noir: and whats that when its at home, you may ask.  Unusually bloody and violent, lightened, a bit, by that dark Scots humor.  Written (duh!!) by a Scot, which McDermid is, Scots-born.At any rate, the series is set in McDermids fictional \"Bradfield,\" it is filmed in Manchester, the actual city in which she sets her work, after doing 16 years there as a journalist.  Manchesters an interesting city to use: handsome and hardly ever seen here, full of interesting looking architecture, with a highly diverse population.  Unfortunately, the cast has been encouraged to make use of the local accent and dialect, and there are no subtitles, a puzzling oversight considering Greens standing at Granada.  It makes the series quite difficult to follow for us on these shores.1. \"Colour of Amber.\"  A white man appears to have kidnapped a young black girl on a busy street, in the morning rush hour.  A strong complex mystery, dealing with interracial matters; focusing on children damaged by the adults in their lives.2. \"Nocebo.\"  A sadistic, ritualistic killer seems to be at work, targeting children.  Another strong, intense episode, more daring in its treatment of blacks than an American tv program would ever be, giving us a really unflattering portrait of a black voodoo-oriented preacher, Dr.Kingston.3. \"Names of Angels.\" A serial killer seems to be targeting attractive, blond young businesswomen.  A clever, perhaps too clever, outing.  Notable chiefly for the introduction of a character, clearly based on one of the ten-year olds who tortured and killed two-year old James Bulger in Liverpool in February 1993.  \"Christopher\" has been a patient of Hills while imprisoned for the crime, and, as he was so young when he committed it, he is being released as a young man.  Hill is greatly concerned with his well-being.4. \"Anything You Can Do.\" Yet another apparent serial killer at work, putting bags over the heads of his victims.  Another clever one, but a good mystery that once again ventures where American TV will never go.  Continues the sad arc of \"Christopher,\" the released Liverpool child murderer.Green is, of course, a handsome man, and a good actor, and he gives us an intense, intelligent portrait of Dr. Hill.  If only we could make out what hes saying.",

It is scheduled to be released as a separate DVD on August 5th 2008. Each episode is about 83 minutes in length. This is a quality series that seems to improve each year as the character delvelopment matures.~ ~ SEASON 5 EPISODES ~ ~Episode One: Prayer of the BoneIn the season premiere, Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green) finds himself a fish out of water when hes invited to Texas as an expert witness in a case where an Iraq combat veteran has confessed to brutally slaughtering his wife and two young children. His defense team claims that hes suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but the prosecution asks Tony, who met with the soldier in the UK, to join them in disproving that claim. Alone in a strange country, surrounded by hostile lawyers and police, Tony finds himself at the center of a death penalty case with competing legal and political interests. Hes insulted, threatened, framed, and physically attacked while the case takes a strange turn. Everyone seems to have a vested interest in the case - everyone except the suspect, who strangely seems determined to die.Episode Two: The Color of AmberWhen a woman sees a young girl being snatched by a man in a car, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib) fears they may only have hours to get her back alive. Since only one percent of the victims in abduction cases survive beyond a day, new ACC James Morrison (Christopher Colquhoun) reacts by calling an Amber alert, which floods the media with public pleas for information. He also pulls Tony in to help with profiling likely abductors.Episode Three: NoceboAlex investigates the murder of a teenage girl and a young boy, who bear signs of ritual killings. The trail leads to a property tycoon wholl stop at nothing to get the rent, a preacher whose healing activities involve animal sacrifice, and a self-styled artist whose works not only depict violence, but are painted in blood. Tony puzzles over what the killer might want to gain and why. Is this religion? And is it one killer or two, with one suspect the acolyte of another?Episode Four: The Names of AngelsTwo women are found raped and strangled, wearing the clothing of victims killed years earlier in Europe. Is the killer boasting to police about past crimes, leaving bodies where they can easily be found? And why is he choosing victims from the business world? As Tony tries to unravel the deadly puzzle, hes confronted by an unpleasant distraction - an 18-year-old released killer turns up on his doorstep.Episode Five: Anything You Can DoWhen a vulnerable elderly woman is suffocated in her home, Alex and Tony suspect Bernard Kelly (Ian Peck), a security guard who has a dysfunctional relationship with his mother and was seen at the scene of the crime by several witnesses. But when the killings escalate, it appears to be the work of more than one murderer. Could the deaths be connected to the sudden return of Tonys old hero, respected psychologist Jonathan Goode?. . .",

    "reviewText": "I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the \"cozy\" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",

I liked how the characters interacted.  I moved to a different community when I was fairly young, but it was the opposite way.  I was going from a big city to a small, farming community.  So, I could relate to trying to fit in with the new community.Even if things are sometimes overdone, this series touches on points that few TV shows have.  Theres been a few about racism, bigotry, fitting in, considering the future, etc, but this was the first time I watched a show, that was made for people under 18, about homosexuality.  This is why I find it to be a progressive show, since young people need to understand that there are people like this.  They dont have to exactly agree with everything, but I like how the show shows them as normal teenagers, which is how it is in reality.  Of course, I think some parents need to see this show for the same reason.I am hoping for a DVD release, and the Unbox is still missing 3 episodes from the 3rd season, namely \"Cant Buy Me Love\", \"Career Day\", and \"Spencers 18th Birthday\".  Hopefully, these episodes will be posted at some point, too.  Im only getting these in the Unbox form to show my support for this series, even though its been out for a while.",

It has good storylines, character development, and is has great plots.For those who think that Danny Phantom is for kids only, theyre wrong. I am a teenager myself and I love the show. You dont have to be a kid to like it (even Though its rated TV-Y7-FV).For those of you who dont know what the show is about, let me tell you. This show takes place in a fictional city called Amity Park. 14-year-old Danny Fenton and his friends, goth-girl Samantha \"Sam\" Manson, and techno-geek Tucker Foley, attend Casper High. Dannys parents are too obsessed with ghosts that they dont really think about anything else. One day there was an accident in his parents lab and he got ghost powers. He now protects the city of Amity Park from all kinds of ghosts, while avoiding ghost hunters like the \"Guys in White\" and his parents. Trying to keep his ghost half a secret while avoiding Mr. Lancers wrath (his teacher) Sam and Tucker always have Dannys back when he needs them.I hope this review was helpful. Its one of my top favorite cartoons. I give it two thumbs up!",

Sure, there will be some comedians that you like more or less than others, but all of them will bring a smile to your face.I appreciate that Comedy Central does keep the language controlled, especially since so many comedians seem to drop those bombs so frequently. The &#34;bleeps&#34; are annoying, but I would rather hear them than the swearing.  I do wish they would keep out some of the indecent topics and references.  I am not expecting wholesome, child-friendly comedy, but I think we should be able to expect to not be uncomfortable hearing it with friends in the room.Overall, I find these quick little stand up sessions to be great entertainment while hanging out with friends or even waiting at the airport.

    "reviewText": "Unlike the previous manufactured on demand (MOD) using DVD-Rs releases that had been available on Amazon, this is an official release by Shout! Factory. The picture and sound on this 4 disc release is great and each disc has 5 episodes on it. Also unlike the MOD release, this release has nicer main menus on the discs (the theme song plays while it loops through character images) and each episode has chapters (meaning when you click the next button it doesnt skip the entire episode). Like the MOD release this release has no extras, but that wont stop me from buying the seasons 2 and 3 releases though (I love this show and I personally dont care that much if it has no extras/bonus features - extras/bonus features are just that to me, an extra/a bonus, especially when its only $20 -  but again thats me, I know others look at extras/bonus features when making a decision to buy a DVD). The only \"flaws\" I found with this release is that on the inside of the case it lists what episodes are on each disc, but it does not list them in the order they actually play on each disc (except disc 2, that one is listed in the same order it actually plays on the disc), and the cover image is from season 2, not 1. Neither of these \"flaws\" affect the great quality of the show or the DVDs of course, I just wanted to mention them for those who may care and to give a detailed product review. This set does contain and play all 20 episodes of the first season in the correct order (except #2 and #3 are swapped, but it doesnt affect the story or anything). Below is the order the episodes play:1.  Mystery Meat2.  One of a Kind (supposed to be episode 3)3.  Parental Bonding (supposed to be episode 2)4.  Attack of the Killer Garage Sale5.  Splitting Images6.  What You Want7.  Bitter Reunions8.  Prisoners of Love9.  My Brothers Keeper10.  Shades of Gray11.  Fanning the Flames12.  Teacher of the Year13.  \"13\"14.  Public Enemies15.

The story of a forteen year old average simple minded teenage boy with two friends that keeps on being mocked and bullied buy theself appointed \"cool group\" of the other schollars his own age who suddenly gotghost powers by accident because his friends pushed him into going into the ghost portal that didnt function correctly when he accidently whithout noticing pressed the button inside it is brilliant! When you see the ghost that came to life inside him and created the his ghost self it is actually quite clear that he isnt just half-half, but two in one. He became two and existed in two forms. His plain ordinary live human self and his live lifeless ghost self with all the powers. There are several episodes as proof of this. The first is the \"Splitting Images\"episode when Danny was mistaken for being the bully by Poindexter when he took overDannys body and drove Danny Phantom through the mirror into his world. When Poindexter got thrown back through the mirror with Dannys body into his own worldDanny tells him \"Now I want my body and my life back!\". The second time is in thecomedy episode of \"Identity Crisis\". When Danny tried to get rid of his ghost self.By using his dads ghost catcher he seperated his ghost self from his human selfand they both got mad and acted like clowns. Another one is \"The Ultimate Enemy\" When Danny again seperated his ghost self from his human self aswell as Vlad. When Danny did this his ghost self lost all controll over himself and became furious and combined with Vlads ghost self and since Vlad is evil and seriously wanted to murder Jack aswell as Danny, Danny killed his human self. The main reason why I amso mad about this show is because of all the things his ghost self does. All thesuperhero stuff he does and adventures he has in his ghost form and all the natural obstacles he has to deal with everyday as his normal human self. Also ifyou think about it it is quite true that his normal human self will grow up, get older and some time, somewhere his last hour will come and he will pass away but hisghost self, (who actually is also Danny Fenton but is just given a more ghostly likenickname by his human self and also to hide his true identity), will always be there looking and sounding exactly the same as his 14 year old human self becauseghosts never ages because they are lifeless. Hell even be able to attend his ownfuneral. And during the years of his adult life hell always look like his 14 year old self whenever he goes ghost. Hell always be there for centuries to come along with all the other ghosts of deceased people like Johnny 13, Kitty, Desiree, Ember Mclain, possibly Walker and Technus, the Box Ghost etc. These are just some of the reasons why I love this show so much and why I am such a big fan of it.",

    "reviewText": "Of course, the biggest problem are the missing episodes. Its NOT the complete first season, but seeing as a lot of people already complained about that, I wont discuss that in detail. It just makes you feel like youve been cheated. After all the text on the DVD itself lies to you and it isnt really cheap, either.Before those DVDs were \"released\" I had bought all episodes in digital form and created my own box-sets. And I have to say, I actually still prefer those. The \"design\" of this DVD is just loveless, everything seems simply slapped on. Every fan could make a hundred times more appealing one.The quality of the DVDs is decent, but strangely enough they dont work on my player. I have a RC2-Player, so it sort of figures, but it never had problems with any RC1-DVD. It actually opens the DVD and shows the menu (again, totally loveless, doesnt even have any kind of BG-music), but it wont play the episodes. Huh. Comes with the DVD-on-demand, I guess.But I knew about all those points (except for the DVD-player problem), so why did I still buy it? Because Im a *Phan*, thats why. I dont know if Danny Phantom will ever get a real DVD-set, so I am glad for every chance I have to get an \"official\" DVD./EDIT: FORGET WHAT I SAID.They changed the set so it now includes ALL EPISODES as advertised!!! THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH.",

    "reviewText": "In 2004, American animator and series creator Butch Hartman had created the animated series \"Danny Phantom\".  Aired on Nickelodeon in 2004-2007, the series was produced by Billionfold Studios.\"Danny Phantom\" is a series that focused on the adventures of a teenager named Danny Fenton who has parents who are well-known ghost hunters.  His parents created a Ghost Portal which would bridge the real world with the Ghost Zone but when Danny tried to use it, the Ghost Portal didnt work.  But while inside the portal, he turned on the \"on\" button (which his parents forgot existed) and it activated the portal.Because he was inside of the portal, the portal fused with his DNA with ectoplasm and now he has been transformed into Danny Phantom.The only one that knows his secret is his best friends Sam (a goth vegetarian) and Tucker (who is a technophile and a meat-lover) but somehow Dannys parents have an inkling that one of their children may be a ghost but instead of think Danny is the ghost, they think its his older sister Jasmine.But Danny now has these powers that allow him to be a ghost which allows him to fly, be invisible and eventually through the season, learns that he has other powers.  And now, Danny uses his powers for good against bad ghosts that are plaguing his hometown.While the series has been released on DVD before (albeit not including all episodes which frustrated \"Danny Phantom\" fans), the license for \"Danny Phantom\" has been acquired by Shout! Factory and fortunately, the first season of \"Danny Phantom\" will feature all 20 episodes on DVD.Episode listing on \"Danny Phantom: Season 1 DVD are as follows (note: these are spoilerless summaries):DISC 1:EPISODE 1 - Mystery Meat  - Danny uses his new ghost powers to take on the ghost Lunch Lady.EPISODE 2 - One of a Kind  - Skulker the ghost hunter has his target set on Danny Phantom.EPISODE 3 - Parental Bonding - Danny uses his \"overshadowing\" power to take control of his dad during a parent-teacher conference.  Meanwhile, a ghost amulet turns a girl that Danny likes into a dragon.EPISODE 4 - Attack of the Killer Garage Sale - Danny sells his parents ghost hunting junk, not knowing that the objects have residual ghost energy and now he must take on Technus, the Spectral Master.EPISODE 5 - Splitting Images - Danny uses his power to get back at Dash, the school bully but accidentally triggers the ghost of Poindexter, a kid who was bullied.DISC 2:EPISODE 6 - What You Want - Wish granter Desiree gives Tucker ghost powers.EPISODE 7 - Bitter Reunions - Danny meets his evil opposite, Vlad Plasmius.EPISODE 8 - Prisoners of Love - Danny fears that he may be breaking his parents up when he accidentally knocks his fathers anniversary gift to the Ghost Zone.EPISODE 9 - My Brothers Keeper - Jazz mistakes her younger brothers ghost hunting as a form of depression and signs him up for therapy.EPISODE 10 - Shades of Gray - A ghost wrecks a popular co-eds school life and now she becomes a ghost hunter.DISC 3:EPISODE 11 - Fanning the Flames - Danny and Sam become romantic thanks to the musical powers of ghost rocker, Ember.EPISODE 12 - Teacher of the Year  - Lancer and Dannys parents put pressure on him to ace a test.  Meanwhile, Technus escapes into Dannys online game.EPISODE 13 - 13 - Jazz falls for a boy ghost, Johnny 13.  Danny must become the overprotective one.EPISODE 14 - Public Enemies  - Amity Park is invaded by ghosts and the ghost sheriff wants to capture Danny Phantom.EPISODE 15 - Fright Night - Danny vs. Dash in a haunted house decorating contest.DISC 4:EPISODE 16 - Maternal Instinct - Maddie wants to bond with her son during the mother/son science seminar.EPISODE 17 - Lucky in Love - Paulina witnesses Dannys ghost transformation.EPISODE 18 - Life Lessons - Danny and Valerie Gray are forced to become parents to a sack of flour for a school assignment.  Meanwhile, Skulker tries to pit the two against each other.EPISODE 19 - The Million Dollar Ghost - Vlad Masters ghost portal explodes and now he wants to use Jack Fentons ghost portal to replace it.EPISODE 20 - Control Freaks - Sam wants to attend the Goth circus, but she is unaware that the performers are ghosts.VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Danny Phantom: Season 1 is presented in full screen (1:33:1) and presented in Dolby Digital.  For those familiar with this animated series, \"Danny Phantom\" uses strong lines around the characters and bold colors.  In fact, the series is quite vibrant and colorful and looks great on DVD.Dialogue, special effects and music are quite clear coming through the center and front channels.  I chose to watch the series via stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part, picture and audio quality for this series on DVD is very good.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Danny Phantom: Season 1 comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:In our household, Butch Hartman animated series reigns supreme.  Every morning, my young son must have his dose of \"The Fair Odd Parents\" or \"T.U.F.F. Puppy\" and before these two series, he was all about \"Danny Phantom\".If anything, it was an introduction for him as a young child to watch a series that brings a ghost hunter taking on bad ghosts in a hilarious and fun way.And many times I have watched this series with him and what I liked about it is that it was a series crafted not just for the kids but also for teens or adults.  These were continuous storylines that feature a young teenager with his powers and also dealing with high school bullies, being unpopular but enjoying life by hanging out with friends but taking on bad ghosts.  So, in a way, it has a similarity to popular superhero storylines such as Spider-Man and Superman (but in a more Dr. Strange meets Ghostbusters kind of way).  And also, he is a character that is not perfect and that many kids probably can relate to.Also, the artistic look of the series, especially with its character designs and its bold strokes will no doubt capture your attention and its a visual style that continues today through Hartmans latest animated series.But the series has a lot of factors that make is so accessible and entertaining.  From Dannys family to his best friends but also the other characters that he meets through school or the ghosts that he encounters, theres always something new in each episode and not rehash of the same stories over and over again.As for the DVD release, yes, this has been released before but in the past, not all episodes were included.  With this latest DVD release from Shout Factory, you get all 20-episodes on four DVDs and one can only hope that Shout continues to bring the other two seasons (including the specials and possibly newer episodes) on DVD as well.Overall, if you were a big fan of \"Danny Phantom\" or young at heart and want an animated series with a ghost-busting storyline, definitely give \"Danny Phantom: Season 1 a try!",

    "reviewText": "First of all, it is nice to see this show available on DVD, especially for those of us who dont want to watch it on a 2 inch screen on an ipod.  The bad news is, this is a print-on-demand disc that has a lot of glitches in it.  As stated in the product description, it is recorded on DVD-R discs and is a manufacture on demand product.  Although it has a slick package design, complete with the Nickolodeon logo and a bar code, and full color imprinted discs, I still cant help but feel that this is little more than something I could have made by setting my DVD recorder to tape the show when it airs.  As a DVD-R disc, it has all the glitches one expects from \"homemade videos.\"  As stated in the product description, it will not play in a DVD-rom or computer drive, but I expected it to playback in a regular DVD player.  Uh, no--my multi-disc player had difficulty reading the disc, as did my portable player, and it got hung up at certain points.  There was nothing more annoying that getting half way through an episode and finding that you wouldnt get to see the end because of the glitch.  incidentally, if you fast-forward the disc, it can bypass the glitch, but you will miss the dialogue.  There are some duplication bloopers as well--for example, after the commercial break, sometimes entire lines of dialogue and even entnire scenes get repeated.Another important aspect is that this is not the \"complete season 1\" as the package and advertising might lead you to believe--it is actually only the first half of the first season.  The episodes are: (1)Mystery Meat (2)One of a Kind (3)Parental Bonding (4) Attack of the Killer GArage Sale (mistakenly titled \"Attack of the Garage Sale\") (5) Splitting Images (6)What You Want (7) Bitter Reunions (8)Prisoners of Love (9)My Brothers Keeper (10) Shades of Gray (11)Fanning the Flames (12)Teacher of the Year and (13) \"13\".  The first 2 discs feature 5 episodes and the last one has only 3, which seemed to be a waste of a disc.  There are no extra features or even subtitles and captioning is non existent, so at the price of $30 plus, it is not qorth it.  The full series is available on I-Tunes so it is not as if there is no demand for it.  If you cant wait and dont want to watch it on an ipod, go ahead and purchase the disc; if you dont mind tiny graphics and a 1 inch screen, go to the Itunes store.",

Sadly, this release is \"bare bones\", so there is no extra content whatsoever :( All that is included is the episodes themselves.

This means they are very delicate and most likely will degrade in a year or two as the purple dye fades.  The authoring on them is slipshod, I couldnt even play the first disc on an older DVD player without the disc skipping and the picture being pixilated beyond anything watchable.  Ended up having to watch it on my PS3.I really, really wanted the series and when its finally released, it looks like a cheap pirate job.  I am sorely disappointed in Nickelodeon, but unless its released on Blu-ray, I hate to say this is the only way to get the series.",

A wonderful lighthearted gem that told the story of a boy growing up while handling his ghost powers in a childrens network managed to create depth, character development, and story arcs that increasingly gets better each episode (unfortunately to drop by the poorly conceived Season Three).Season One starts at the beginning, where were introduced to the main cast and their eccentric personalities. Little by little, the majority of them grow into their defined roles: Danny slowly gains confidence as he balances hero life with his normal alter ego, his older sister Jazz realizes the truth behind her brother and supports his decision in secret while softly embracing her familys ghost life, Valerie turns from a spoiled, rich brat to a kick butt ghost hunter out for revenge (and later, justice), etc. But truly it is the character Vlad Masters who shines with his debonair, mysterious, and complicated persona--his opposites and similarities with Danny all clear--a myth arc that plays a key role on Dannys struggle with darkness. Theres a lot of continuity despite half of the episodes remaining as filler, but since its the first season, those are meant to establish the characters and elements we all learned to love over time.THE GOOD: \"Parental Bonding\" takes in numerous subplots and mixes them flawlessly. \"What You What\" is a roller coaster look into Tuckers inferior complex towards his newly supercharged best friend, delivered without hamming the emotions or loosing any. \"Bitter Reunions\" breaks the status quo and marks the beginning of the manipulatively awesome Vlad. \"Shades of Gray\" takes a pre-existing character and breathes new life into her as Valerie turns from pampered princess to hardened ghost hunter. \"Fanning the Flames\" established a solid story while making the Danny/Sam romance lovable (a farcry when Season Three makes it deplorable). \"Public Enemies\" raises the bar by having an antagonist succeed and Danny maturing to accept his duties. \"Maternal Instincts\" gives a topnotch performance between the mother/son relationship between Danny and Maddie and \"Control Freaks\" managed to prove Sam is more then just Dannys would-be love interest. But the best episode in Season One is the magnificent \"My Brothers Keeper\" which begins the excellent character development of Dannys older sister Jazz who starts off as a know-it-all constantly shielding Danny from the harsh realities of life. There, she begins to see the potential in her kid brother. It is, in my opinion, the most sentimental and heartwarming out of all the Danny Phantom episodes.THE EH, AVERAGE: \"Mystery Meat\" properly introduces the characters and backgrounds, but falters in the second half with less-then-believable subplots. \"One Of A Kind\" shows the first sign of DPs use of Major Plot A and minor subplot B. \"Attack of the Killer Garage Sale\" is fine, but clumsily tries to tie Dannys heroism and normalcy that others succeed better in. \"Prisoners of Love\" does a commendable job showcasing the radically different Ghost Zone, but is tackled with a dumb subplot involve stereotypical rednecks and a predictable romance. \"Teacher Of The Year\" is so morally focused that it feels less Action/Comedy, more Saturday Morning educational program. \"13\" is decent, but lacks oomph. \"Lucky in Love\" enhances the Love Arc and boosts some secondary characters, but is otherwise unremarkable and \"the Million Dollar Ghost\" has a confusing Xanatos Gambit from Vlad and a faulty father/son bonding between Danny and Jack.THE DOWNRIGHT BAD: \"Splitting Images\" which is all-around deplorable. Despite triggering Dannys Growing Darkness Arc, its meshed with a antagonist who lost his purpose halfway through the series and a jarring concept of right vs. wrong between Danny and Sam. And lastly \"Fright Night\" which degrades Dannys current growth by making him unlikeable and jerky.The DVD only covers the first 13 episodes. There are no extras, but the episodes themselves are in good quality. And I will give Nickelodeon credit; they did put the episodes in their PROPER chronological order. All except \"Parental Bonding\" (episode two) and \"One of a Kind\" (episode 3) which got switched with each other. The DVD covers, both front and back are also prone to error. The first volume alone for example has Danny with his \"DP\" chest insignia; something he does not receive until Season Two (partly covered in the second DVD).Hardcore fans will feel ripped off while the casual (the type who considers DVD extras more luxury then mandatory) may enjoy it. Now that the DVD contains all 20 episodes in on boxed set, the once high price is slightly more reasonable, but be warned that it still does not contain any extras, let along subtitles.",

Hwang Jang Lee has 2 fights with Chen Sing and this I thought was the second real highlight of the film to go along with the story.  Southern fist versus northern leg at its best.  Add in Hwnags 3 grand children(corey Yuen, Doris Lung, and Yuen Biao!), and you have yourself a great movie.  I have a couple movies from the Black Dragon and both are watchable but very dirty in print.  I recommend the tree line 50 pack becasue it is cheap and you get a few other really good movies in that collection.",

    "reviewText": "I loved this show when it was on the air and of course, was very upset when it got taken off. Ive been looking for it to come out on DVD everywhere, but no such luck. And then one day I discovered that I could purchase it through Amazon Instant Video for an extremely great price so I did. In watching it again Im reminded of the fact that while this show is yes, yet another one about a town where weird things happen its take on what its characters refer to as \"The Weirdness\" is still as fresh and funny as the first time I saw the TV show.In fact, while the show follows a group of high school students and the adults around them who have to deal with an ever changing and unpredictable weird events that affect them the real star of this show is \"The Weirdness\" itself. This phenomena whose source is never really explained, although hilariously debated in the shows opening by some of its characters from time to time, may one day see ones innermost true thoughts popping up in the form of visible talking thought bubbles that show up when one is trying to lie (Episode Bubbleheads) to everyone slowly turning into cats during the high schools rendition of American Idol (Episode OGrady Idol) and much, much more. This premise allows the show to remain fresh and unpredictable.Im still not sure why it was ever canceled, but this one goes into my bin of TV shows that were simply great and original but canceled by shortsighted morons. (There I said it) If you want a laugh and cant get enough of shows like Eureka and Warehouse 13 then I think youll love this one too. So go ahead and get down with The Weirdness and the whole OGrady gang.",

    "reviewText": "Regarding Gabriel Iglesias...Funny stuff, good light hearted slapstick style comedy. Well done! everyone needs this from time to time.Post below is of Comedy Central overall:I have been watching a bunch of these during editing work. I have noticed a trend of watered down, politically correct on world issues, yes often always using race, sex and a weed smoking as a overwhelming headline topic on these comics.What happen to the jokes on contraversial issues, and world issues? Specially during war, and all the government stripping of rights in the US. Comedians need to use this medium to break the silence of such hard topics.Sure there are funny content here, but seriously, Its either about blacks, and white, and women and men and being stupid, and loving to smoke out. Really?!! Watch Season 13-14, which is what I am currently watching. You just get more of this.  The cover image is of that British comedian who actually DOES bring up such hard topics and lets people interact with such issues. Yet, I have not seen him in any of the line up.I actually cant imagine the comedians being the limiting factor. I think its Comedy Network that filters this content. I hope I am wrong. I will continue watching more and hope to see and hear deeper, and more deep as well as newly stylized material.I liked...Bill Burr,Anthony Jezelneck,Greer Barnes,I will list others, but these I most recently saw.Others I like areLouis CK,Russel Peters,Alonzo Bodden was pretty good,Tom Papa was great,Doug Stanhope,Lewis Black,Kevin Nealon rather funny,Sebastian Maniscalco was Great!,Russel Brand,All Brian Posein was doing talking about his weewee..Ya thats the picture we need in our heads(rather annoying skit),Mike Birbiglia had a great delivery and overall interesting,Ill add more later.",

It may well be that I am one of the few who think that Laura is brilliant and no meaningful segment of the public is into her.  But I just cant believe thats the case.  I believe that if someone would put out a dvd of some of Lauras best routines, the audience would appear.  How about an hour long HBO special?  This video download has moments of Laura at her best, but the energy flags at times and the comedy central presentation always seems dingy.  Give me an hour of the Laura I know and love or, even better, a third season of Jackie Woodman.  As her former Irish boyfriend might say, Laura is the \"otter\" of so much hilarious stuff.

Other guy, yeah you, Smart Alec, if you are reading this, your suggestion to have him try his hand at stand-up, didnt turn out so bad for him after all, huh?! Just think, your inability to ignore his words launched him into the rarefied air of one of the All-Time Best. Guess you can tell your friends, &#34;I was just playing.&#34; This set is the 2nd time I became aware of Patrice Oneal, the first being his appearances on Chappelles Show. Performances like this were the main reason so many would tune in to check out comedians that were not heard of before on a wide scale, and this avenue definitely paid dividends to those whose 20-25 minute set did not bomb. Patrice Oneal clearly had the goods and you can find so many uploads on YouTube that will make you laugh and laugh really loud, but strip down the jokes and you will hear that he was quite pensive in his approach to his jokes. He statement of how America in its arrogance will call its sports champions world champions without playing another country, extremely funny & priceless but so true. From Elephant in the Room, Mr. P & Unreleased, his works are grand and no matter how much and how often you listen to him, youll paused and rewind to hear that bit again and again. His performance here is no different. Dude died entirely too soon and it is hard to refer to him in the past tense. Such a great thing that we get to refer to him at all.",

He has a special and distinct kind of humor.  It really was a tragedy for the world of comedy and those who enjoyed his type of humor, to lose him.It also means, whatever was produced and put out there for sale  of Richard Jenis comedy skits, are pretty much it.So, enjoy what you can of his comedy, by collecting whatever you can find of his, if you do not already own it.I have no idea if one day, production might stop.It is a bummer not to be able to find other work by him- even obscure work.What would be nice, is if his family/estate, put together another video of his work, where nothing is a repeat of other performances/skits.The passing of Jeni garnered a lot of attention and posts of sympathy on his website.His family was appreciative and even went out of their way to let people know that Ricard Jeni had suffered from  mental illness - which is why he was a victim of suicide. I think they actually wanted people to know and not hide it as a way to promote mental health awareness.Certainly it shocked everyone when it was announced how he died- but it also made him very human. He was NOT just a successful celebrity comedian- he, too, was a troubled human being.The messages on his site, were left by countless dedicated Jeni fans.As time moved on, it seems that other than true Jeni Fans,( which do still exist) he has been forgotten- which is sad.Because it seems he has been forgotten, it makes  me wonder if the family/estate would even think to put together a video of works by Jeni.If only they knew there are so many people that wish Jeni was still around; making people laugh till they cried or had a stomach ache, with his zany, comedic ways :-(So shop around for other examples of Jenis work, here on Amazon, and just make sure you read the amount of minutes it runs.Hey- you live and your learn. So I am giving you the heads up- dont make the mistake we made renting this quick clip from Comedy Central. Its over before you  blink.RIP- to Richard Jeni, a down to earth talent, lost to us, way too soon.",

She actually made some jokes that raised my eyebrows since she is now a lesbian. I didnt like this because it seemed hypocritical but I think Wanda Sykes is really funny. She is one of the few comedians who can make me really LOL (Laugh Out Loud). If you want to see what her comedy was like before she came out a lesbian or you are a Wanda Sykes fan, watch it. I am a huge fan of hers. I would like to see her in a live how. I am glad she is true to herself now and came out as a lesbian.

I really havent seen it here. There were a few that got some deep laughs from me, but not many.  The rest were like watching a high school kid trying to hit serious major league pitching.  Miserable.  It felt the audience were just giving polite obligatory laughter.  Slapstick, sarcasm, absurd observation of real events, twisting the news relating life events and Daria like delivery are main ingredients that make up stand-up work, one still has to use perfect delivery.  If the home viewer doesnt find themselves belly laughing by the first commercial break, time to move on. Unlike the audience, I didnt directly pay to see this. But like its said, Comedy in the eyes of the beholder.",

Daily (Buttercup).My only request now is for Cartoon Network to PLEASE start releasing Dexters Laboratory on dvd!! Cow and Chicken and Courage the Cowardly Dog sets would also be great to have on my shelf!Also maybe,just maybe;could some of these companies consider releasing a set of first AND second season,rather than just one at a time??Esp. with shows like The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy,where the characters really evolve as well as the style of the show (Billy and Mandy just picking on/bullying Grim,to Billy and Mandy working with Grim or at least given the same amount of dishing out and taking abuse)As far as the PPG set goes though,its great and the bonuses really add to its appeal esp. for the great price.P.S. I always used to get razzed by my cousins (guys of course) for watching this show.But I didnt/dont care;cool animation is cool animation!Throw in a bit of adult humor,interesting characters and good plots and youve got some great entertainment!",

Like the best modern animated shows (The Tick Vs. Season One, for example), it manages to combine a kinetic visual style with humor that isnt dumbed-down just because its a \"kids show.\"  Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup may only be 5 years old, but many of the gags are aimed WAY above their heads.  One classic episode (alas, in a later season), \"Meet the Beat-alls,\" is composed almost entirely of references to the Beatles.  The girls chief nemesis, the intelligent simian Mojo Jojo, also seems aimed as much at parents as the kids in the audience.If you think all modern cartoons are too bland, too loud, or too derivative of way-overrated Japanese animation (Teen Titans, Im looking at YOU), give The Powerpuff Girls a try.  Its a rare combination: Smart and funny, with barely a hint of cynicism and crudeness that permeates so much so-called \"family\" programming.",

    "reviewText": "Admit it: if youre a guy and you love this show, its hard to think about people laughing at you for getting into girly stuff. Like youd have to buy it with your head down thinking \"nobody look at me buying this thing yet, its for my daughter\". But its all for nothing as regardless if youre a young boy, girl, parent or just a comedy fan, theres plenty to like about it and the only thing youd have a problem with is who its obvious target audience is.The show follows that familiar cartoon format of a 22 minute episode separated into 2 stories. The episodes on this set range from the great to the good. Theres rarely a clunker in the whole thing and each episode is great to watch. Sure some will obviously stand out among the others but you probably wont find a complete dud on the set. Only gripe you might have with is you wish more episodes were included but leave that for season 2 set, right?Some of the highlights are \"Boogie Frights/Abracadaver\" where in the first half, the Boogeyman blocks out the sun so they can party on the surface whereas the latter as the girls trying to stop a zombie destroying the town. Probably one of the best Bubbles-centered episodes, \"Bubblevicious\" finds Bubbles frustrated shes seen as the baby of the group and decides to take out her frustrations on anything that comes around. Her reaction to being picked for \"Duck, Duck, Goose\" is classic. We also get the double length episodes \"The Rowdyruff Boys\" where Mojo Jojo creates boy counterparts to the girls who are just as tough, maybe even toughter than the girls as well as \"Uh Oh Dynamo\" where an ultra-tough monster forces the girls to go into a mech anime-style.Kind of disappointing are the extras. While we do get creator Craig McCrackens original pilot for the show the \"Whoop*** Girls\", we also get some rather questionable (read: for the kiddies) inclusions such as Space Ghost premiere and probably one of the most unprofessional interviews Ive ever seen. So much for insight. Also wouldve been nice to get some commentaries from McCracken and animation director (and Samurai Jack creator) Genndy Tartakovsky but oh well.While the extras are rather lackluster but the draw is the episodes and here they deliver, no matter how girly it feels.",

    "reviewText": "I was hooked on the Powerpuff Girls Waay back in 1995, when the first short \"Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins\" first aired on the old \"What A Cartoon\" series.I imeadately began a four year e mail campaign to beg CN to turn this cartoon into a series. It was funny, witty, and just about the best thing to hit cartoons since Jay Wards glory days.In 1999, CN finally relented, and made the PPG a weekly offering.The first season is truly the best of the lot, as some of the funniest and most innovative cartoons of the series were made, such as \"Telephonies\" , where the Ganggreen Gang makes crank calls on the PPG Hotline, and \"Major Competition\", where an arrogant Superman clone takes Townsville away from the girls, and then turns chicken when a real crisis hits, and so on.Lots of us older fans have gotten flak from the younger ones, pushing the old tired myth that cartoons are only for kids. Well, Im 52 at the time of this review, and I am not ashamed to be a fan of this great show.I only have 3 words for CN and WB:Give us more... Please!",

The packaging is a lot of fun (the two discs are Blossoms eyes, with the surrounding picture being her face), and the nine episodes I hadnt seen are cool (with the exception of \"Insect Inside\"--roaches creep -me- out!)...and best of all, -no commercials-!My only complaint is that the collection is a little lean on extras.  Sure, theres the original McCracken student film (along with a few other pencil storyboards), a CN short, and a couple of interviews, but it would have been nice to have at least a few commentaries--either by McCracken and his creative bunch, or maybe by the characters themselves (as was done on sections of the PPG movie)--to let us viewers inside the creative process.  Idve traded those storyboards -and- an interview for that!But all in all, its worth the price...and Im looking forward to the second season already!",

    "reviewText": "Thank you for finally releasing the entire 1st season of the Puffs!!About 9 months ago, my 3-year old daughter stumbled across a bonus episode of the Powerpuff Girls (\"Boogie Frights\") at the end of a Scooby-Doo video tape.  I got home and my wife asked, \"What is this?  She wants to keep watching this and she absolutely loves it!\"  I smiled and told her that it was the Powerpuff Girls, of course!I was in my 20s when I first came across them in Cartoon Network and it was one of my secret, guilty pleasures to watch (its not something you share around the water cooler casually).  But lets face it - the Powerpuff Girls offer fun viewing for kids and adults because there is humor for both.So, I picked up all the Powerpuff stuff available on DVD for my daughter and was saddened to see that some of my more favorite episodes (\"Octi Evil\" to name one) were not out there and that a great number of episodes were sadly missing.But now heres Season 1!!!  It overlaps some of what Ive already collected, but a little more than half of Season 1 contains episodes that I didnt previously have.  To have an entire Season for $19.99 is also a fairly smoking deal;  its 4 hours and 50 minutes of viewing material!!!!!That said, some parents might be put off by the violence in the cartoon, so I leave that up to an individuals taste.  In our household, we pass it off as humor because ALL of it is make-believe and our daughter accepts that; she doesnt go around punching things because she thinks that she is a Powerpuff Girl.  She does like having her hair put up like Bubbles, though.  ;)Anyway, a toast to Craig McCracken (creator).  Heres to hoping that you release em all because I will sure be in line to buy every single one.",

Its Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, back and better than ever in their very first thirteen episodes in one of Cartoon Networks groundbreaking hit shows.  Such episodes include:\"Monkey See, Doggy Do\" - Mojo Jojo uses the cursed Anubis head to literally make Townsville go to the dogs.\"Octi Evil\" - The evil manifestation preferably known as HIM uses Bubbles favorite stuffed toy to do his bidding.\"Major Competition\" - A strapping new superhero named Major Man becomes Townsvilles new guardian.  What will the girls do now ?\"Paste Makes Waste\" - A strange boy named Elmer Glue eats so much school glue, he turns into a giant paste monster the girls have to fight.\"The Bare Facts\" - The oblivious Mayor of Townsville has been rescued by the girls from Mojo Jojo.  Now the girls each tell the Mayor the... \"naked truth\" on what happened back there.\"Impeach Fuzz\" - Fuzzy Lumpkins runs for Mayor and wins by a landslide.  How will the former Mayor get his title back ?\"The Rowdyruff Boys\" - Sick and tired of being defeated by the girls, Mojo Jojo creates Brick, Boomer, and Butch, male counterparts to the girls.In addition to this stunning first season of episodes, the second disc is power-packed with amazing special extra features such as:- The two pilot episodes \"Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins\" and \"Crime 101\".- Archive interviews with Craig McCracken including a special Space Ghost episode.- Bits and promos out the wazoo !- And, of course, Craigs original short film, \"Whoopass Stew\" with exclusive animatics.If youve been a bona fide fan of the PPGs for many years to come, you really must get this DVD set whether or not youve owned the previous DVDs like \"The Mane Event\" and \"Meet the Beat-Alls\", but its totally worth it.  I really hope the rest of the series be out on DVD real soon.  In the meantime, go online to Cartoon Network Video and watch Powerpuff Girls and other former hit shows whenever you like.As the saying goes, \"So once again, the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls !\"",

Sad because I love the show, but so far imo the 1st season is the only real release so far.  Other than that the quality is good, but cheaper to download and make your own bootleg dvds!",

The packaging looks just as professional as any official release. Unfortunately there are no bonus features on this season like there were on Season 1, but the episodes are great and its overall a very enjoyable DVD. A must have for any Zoey fan. It also includes the episode Spring Breakup so theres no need to buy the Spring Breakup DVD separately.DISC ONEBack to PCA- Zoey and Nicole are freaked out by their new roommate, LolaTime Capsule- Chase is desperate to find out what Zoey said about him on her DVD for the classs time capsuleElection- Zoey and Chase compete against each other for class presidentBad Girl- Dustin begins dating a troublesome girl in his classRobot Wars- Zoey and her friends need Quinns help to build a robot for a robot warDISC TWOHaunted House- Dustin and his roommate disappear in the haunted houseBroadcast Views- Zoey and Logan help launch a new debate showLola Likes Chase- Lola develops a crush on Chase after he tutors her in biologyPeople Auction- Zoey, Nicole, and Lola are forced to be Logans personal cheerleadersQuinns Alpaca- Quinn misses her alpaca OtisDISC THREEGirls Will Be Boys- Lola dresses as a guy and pretends to be Logan and Chases new roommateSpring Breakup (Double length episode)- Zoey and her friends spend spring break at Logans house and compete on a new show called Gender DefendersAlso note that the episodes are in order of production code, not air date.

Dan Schneider, the producer, is a genius. Its a great dvd but it didnt contain all the bloopers or all the audition casts. The sound is great and the visual colors are eye candy. When does season 2 of Zoey 101 come out on dvd... Im dying here. When will unfabulous and the rest of Drake and Josh come out on DVD? All in all, although it is only thirteen episodes plus season 3 quarantine,... it still is an amazing price. I had to buy the dvd on [...] because this dvd was not released outside of the states... not even in canadad!!!",

And plus its painful to watch and know that it was towards the ending of show.But anyways...you want to know about what I thought of season 1: Basically, I thought it was terrific. The episodes were consisted of wide variety topics as any great sitcom is. Who doesnt love the Jet X episode where Zoey makes a very creative commercial out of crappy argument footage! Or the episode where the kids form a Disc-Golf team to get out of Gym. It made me want to find sneaky ways to get out of GYM too.Overall, the show is great. I think it is one of the best shows Nickelodeon has ever had to offer. It is an extreme shame that these Mothers couldnt accept how strong Jamie Lynn was, and that she could have continued on with the show. And one last thing, this season is reasonably priced; But as far as the other 3 seasons, $35 is outrageous! I read that Season 4, which is around like $35, doesnt even include all the episodes! So, just a warning to people who choose to buy the other seasons as well; try and buy it used.",

No buffering needed if using a Cable connection or higher, havent tested with DSL or lower) No commercials make it easy to watch and you hardly notice where commercials would have gone. Little about the show: Zoey (Jamie-Lynn Spears), is a very down to earth \"average\" girl who starts school at PCA [Pacific Coast Academy] which is a private school that used to be a all boys school. She moves in with her two roomates, meets her best friend, and several other friends. Each episode is based relatively on day to day life living at school. Highly recommended show.

But I remember my first viewing of it sometime in the 90s (I know, really late to the party) and I fell in LOVE! Ugh, there was just something about it that made me obsessed with it. For some strange reason there is a sense of tranquility that I got from that one viewing that there just doesnt seem to be on TV anymore.From that one viewing, I started watching it religiously, it came on as a two hour block. And I watched every flippin two dang hours, every dang day of the week. And was happy to find out that they spazzed out with marathons of it on weekends! I was in Bonanza heaven! And then the networks took it from me! No more Little Joe, Hoss - Adam! I had some serious withdrawals. And I was not only shocked but a little bit upset to find out that this classic television show was not available on DVD!But that has been fixed. The packaging is OK. Nothing to rave about. It doesnt even come in a box! You just get two dvd cases. Would it have killed Paramount to give us loyal viewers a customized box! You do get a summary of each episode and you do get the original theme song. Yes, I find that very important. On youtube, you get some bastardized version and when I want my Bonanza I want the original. The discs look great, a bump in quality than what they usually look like on television. The extras are not mind blowing, some of them consist of: alternate pilot ending, a tribute remembering Michael Landon/Dan Blocker etc.I dont have to recommend the show to those who love it, but for those who dont, give it a chance.",

First of all, I dont like color television. Dont like that color for nothin. Saw Bonanza at my in-laws. Its not for me. The Ponderosa looked fake. Hardly recognized Little Joe.But more importantly, the portrayal of male-female relations was out of whack. Ya got these four guys living on the Ponderosa and ya never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. I mean ya never hear Hoss say to Little Joe, \"I had such morning wood when I woke up this morning.\" They dont talk about broads - nothing. Ya never hear Little Joe say, \"Hey, Hoss, I went to Virginia City and I saw a girl with the greatest ass Ive ever seen in my life.\" You never hear Little Joe say \"Hey Pa, Im goin into town to get a piece of ass.\" They just walk around the Ponderosa: \"Yes, Pa, wheres Little Joe?\" Nothin about broads. I dont think Im being too picky. But, if at least once, they talked about getting horny. I dont care if you live on the Ponderosa or in Baltimore, guys talk about getting laid. Plus, you got Lorne Greene with 3 sons, all from different mothers, who are about 5 years younger than he is. What, each one died giving birth? Im beginning to think that show doesnt have too much realism. Unless of course, you have your head up your oyster......",

    "reviewText": "At least I hope this is the first of many complete seasons to come. There are 32 episodes of Bonanza in the first season. You can buy just volume one or two, but I cant imagine why you would.Bonanza explores the adventures of the Cartwright family consisting of three-time widower Ben Cartwright and his three sons Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. Each son has a different mother and a very different background. Adams mother is from New England, Hoss mother had Scandinavian roots and met Ben out on the Great plains when Ben and Adam were on the way west after Bens first wife died. Little Joes mother was a southerner from New Orleans. This difference in roots is explored even in the first season when Little Joe almost joins the Confederate army after having someone come into town and stir up his feelings for his southern roots. However, the full story doesnt come out until after this season. There is one episode each in seasons two, three, and four that are dedicated to telling the story of each of Bens wives.This first season follows the successful roadmap that all of the seasons did.  Many have a guest star that is recognized even today. For example, Yvonne De Carlo is the guest star in the first episode. Alan Hale Jr. (The Skipper of Gilligans Island) also makes the first of several guest appearances he will make over the years during this first season.Most episodes involve heavy-hitting drama often involving some injustice which the Cartwrights, with their prominent place in the community, are in a place to right. However, there are a few almost completely comedic episodes here and there. The odd thing is, nobody did comedy as well as Bonanza did when Bonanza decided to do comedy, and usually Hoss is at the center of it all.The show never really produces a long story arc. Each episode pretty much stands alone. The show really had only two disruptions. The first, which didnt prove fatal to the show, was when Pernell Roberts left in the late 1960s. His \"place\" was taken by Candy. Candy was not another son - he was a hired hand, but he was also a trusted friend of the Cartwrights.The second disruption probably was fatal by most accounts. Dan Blocker, who played Hoss, died suddenly of a heart attack in 1972. The show only lasted one more season before it was cancelled. Blockers character of Hoss wasnt the most handsome of the Cartwrights in the conventional sense, but he was the heart and very much the sense of humor of the show. His loss was irreplacable.",

Unfortunately it was aired every Sunday at 5 p.m. when my parents took me to the mountains to visit my grandmother.Each time I urged them to drive back home half an hour earlier, but for years I missed the first half hour of \"Bonanza\" :(. Now I finally get a chance to see my favorite episodes in full length.\"Laramie\" and \"A Man called Shenandoah\" were wonderful, too! Fortunately \"Laramie\" was shown on Saturday afternoon and \"Shenandoah\" on Tuesday early in the evening.The best of them all however was \"Yancy Derringer\" which was aired on Wedneadays. This was in 1967.I also enjoyed \"Checkmate\", although I preferred \"Honey West\" and \"Bourbon Street\". Then there was \"M Squad\" which was almost as good as \"The Detectives\" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about \"M Squad\" and \"The Detectives\" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.Many of those who loved the \"Lassie\", \"Flipper\", \"Fury\" and \"Gentle Ben\" TV series in their childhood also liked \"Kentucky Jones\" (Dennis Weaver) and \"The Farmers Daughter\" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like \"A Man called Shenandoah\" (Robert Horton), \"Hank\" (Dick Kallman), \"He and She\" (Paula Prentiss), \"The Magic Boomerang\", \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",

    "reviewText": "I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.Unsurprisingly, the best of the best include all three Michael Landon shows in the top ten. Bonanza makes the list at No. 5, making it the greatest of the many western shows that have been featured on TV.Landon&#8217;s Bonanza character, Joe Cartwright, blends perfectly with the upright character of his father Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene), his quirky brother Hoss (Dan Blocker) and his serious brother Adam (Pernell Roberts).Roberts left the show after the sixth season, but it did not turn out to be a show-terminating setback because Roberts&#8217; character was so much like Greene&#8217;s. The three remaining Cartwrights carried on as if Adam weren&#8217;t missed.Bonanza&#8217;s stories were fitted to the drama and romance of the old west, full of humor and conflict. The Cartwright&#8217;s characterizations were brilliant as were those of the many Hollywood stars who paraded across the credit lines of Bonanza shows for fourteen seasons.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleason&#8217;s Honeymooners. This list features at least one show from every era of TV.",

I resisted buying those \"Fan Favorites\" offers because I knew what would happen. Maybe (or not) I would finally get that one episode that I liked best, but I would also get at least 3 duplicate copies of other episodes that I consider a little less than great.Now I can get all 14 seasons with just one copy of each episode and be able to play my favorites when I want to see them.  No more tuning in a rerun HOPING it is one of my favorites.  I have watched about half of season 1 so far and am almost completely satisfied.  Yes, I said almost.It irritates me when I slip in a DVD of one of my favorite TV shows and there is no option to \"play all.\"  Im settling back for a few hours of my favorite show, and I cant just say play all the episodes on this disk. I have to select the second episode after the first one is finished, then select the third, etc.  Its not that selecting another episode is such hard work for me or my thumb, it is just sloppy programming.  I worked with computers and did some programming, so I know it is not hard work to place such an option on the menu.  I hope that will be corrected with season 2.And please do not release half the seasons and then just quit on your customers.  I have 4 seasons of another one of my favorite shows, and now have been waitng 2 years for the last 5 seasons.  Dont do this to me again, Paramount!",

It can be heavy-handed at times with its moralizing, with Lorne Green and Pernell Roberts as the &#34;heavies&#34; and Dan Blocker and Michael Landon to lighten the mood.  Okay, lets be honest, Michael Landon was also the &#34;chick magnet.&#34;  Hoss is essential to the show as the comic relief.  Sometimes the endings of the shows seem rushed or contrived, as if the writers suddenly realized that they have used 48 of their 50 minutes and need to wrap it up quickly.  All in all, we enjoy the shows and I enjoy being able to watch a show where the sexual content is limited to brief kisses and there are no language issues.",

Now that Pernell Roberts and David Dortort have recently passed away, we have lost all of the Cartwrights and their creator.  So it is wonderful to finally have in my hands the OFFICIAL first season of Bonanza, Volumes 1 & 2.  Unfortunately, legalities prevent the entire 14 seasons from being officially released in the US (although you can pick them up in Germany!)  Other than that, you can search for \"Best of\" releases, but the music we all know and love--the anthem of the Ponderosa--wont be on those discs because of copyright infringements.  And the quality of the picture wont be there either--they will seem like bootleg copies---probably because they pretty much are!  They are copied ad nauseum from public domain copies and youll get grainy pictures--but not with THIS DVD collection!  No, the Theme Music is there and the sound is crisp and sharp!  The production values are perfect and the picture youll see is also sharp as if it were the first time you ever saw the show!I was misled by those who bought it before I did, that the set included certain television specials commemorating Michael Landon, but no---the extras are merely video tapes of David Dortort reminiscing about the actors and the show in general.  They are still interesting, but very brief clips.Nevertheless, if you are a die-hard Bonanza fan, you will love the Official Bonanza DVD set.  All I can say is Hurry up and release the rest of the 14 seasons before were too old and on fixed incomes!!!",

The first full set of uncut episodes from the original series with the original music has been released and it is terrific!  Included are some enticing extras such as behind the scenes photos, original NBC peacock logo and bumpers, promos for the show, interviews with people associated with the series and the infamous clip of the Cartwrights actually singing (well, sort of) the words from the theme.  For those of us who are true fans, however, just having the episodes uncut as they were meant to be is more than enough.The only thing that could top this would be for the powers that be to continue to release additional seasons on a regular basis (quickly!) of the same high quality until diehard fans are able to own the entire 14 seasons of this classic family western.

These episodes explain where teh title of the show came from.I remember as a kid scratching my head wondering \"What does Bonanza mean?  A friend of mine looked it up in the dictionary and told me.  I was still left scratching my head wondering, \"So what does taht have to do with the TV show?\"It wasnt until many years later that I found out.  If you do not yet know, now you can find out from the first few episodes of the first season (in Volume 1).  You get two seperate volumes in the set.Special Features include interviews with the shows creator and writer David Dortort.The alternate ending to the \"Bonanza\" TV pilot in which the Cartrights sing the lyrics to the \"bONANZA\" THEME is also included in the Special Features.It also includes a black and white theatrical short done by David Dortort based on an historical character from Navada, Bill Stewart, first lawyer/prosecutor of Virginia City.  Stewart later on becomes Nevadas first U.S. Senator.  An actor also plays Bill Stewart in one of teh early \"Bonanza\" episodes.Again, if you like \"Bonanza,\" you will like this DVD set.",

So much better than trying to find a tv station and watching the show butchered by ads.  And for me, with a hearing loss, the closed captioning option (english) is fantastic!  All the cheap knock-off dvds do not have this option and can often be difficult to understand.  And the authorized dvds have the proper music that went with the original series.  Not too technically minded, but the color seems great and the sound fine.  And they included some nice behind the scenes photos and some of the original promos etc.  All in all. I felt the price was worth the item.  Of course, I now understand that the dvds were originally offered 1/2 season at a time, and that is why the vol 1 etc was sold separately.  My thanks to the folks who purchased the singles and encouraged the makers to come out with season 1 vol 2 and finally season 2 vol 1.",

The color is crystal, the picture gorgeous, the sound perfect, and the special features are terrific. I watched six episodes today and two yesterday and I bet Ill get another dozen knocked out before the weekend is over -- Bonanza never gets old. And having it on DVD with the original music, with special features, and in a format that means you dont have to plug up the region free player or watch some fuzzy public domain piece is just so special!I grew up during Bonanzas first run -- we are the same age. I was born in July 59; the series debuted in September of that year. I still remember sitting on the floor of our little apartment in Chicago eagerly watching and learning my moral code from Bonanza and shows like it. There are worse ways to grow up. This was a great show and though I have watched it many times since, its either been in syndication with chunks cut for more commercials, or on fuzzy public domain DVDs with hollow sound and weird music. When I bought the German DVDs, even then I found an occasional odd piece cut. And figuring out the German menus and bringing up the English soundtrack is something I could figure out, but it is wonderful not to have to! Im loving this boxed set and eagerly awaiting season 2. Dont let it be too long, TPTB!!!",

Im now the proud owner of the U.S. releases, seasons one through five, and will continue to purchase the remaining nine seasons as they become available. Why buy the U.S. DVDs when I already own the others? The color is more vivid, the sound more crisp and alive, and while the extras are a treat for a Bonanza fan, theyre also educational and just plain interesting. The photo gallery offers never before released photos, and the interviews and footage are spectacular to see.Yes, Bonanza was a fictional series, but many of the episodes touched on actual places, events, and people who made Virginia City and the Territory of Nevada / state of Nevada what it is today.For a show that was under production in the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, the topics covered were not always \"safe\". Mistreatment and misunderstanding of the Native Americans, the greed of many who sought their fortunes in the mines, the women who entertained in the saloons and the traveling shows, the need for safety in the mines. From swindlers to bigots to robbers to murderers, Bonanzas first season covered them all within the confines of acceptable network television of the era. These episodes gave us a glimpse into what it was like to brave the untamed west - and left us to ponder just how much \"rougher\" life in the 1860s really was.I highly recommend Bonanza, Season One for anyone who enjoys westerns, classic television shows, handsome cowboys and ranchers, and of course, the Cartwright philosophies on life!",

Retail is closer to 70 bucks! Even for a classic like Bonanza, that is absurd!  Paramount has done this for the past few years, putting out partial season sets of shows like Cannon, The Untouchables, and The Fugitive.  Yet, they give us full season sets of shows like I Love Lucy, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Mannix. Sometimes, they give us the full 1st season of a show(Gunsmoke, Rawhide) then double back on us by dividing up the following seasons into partial sets.  ENOUGH!  This crap was enough to deal with when people had more money than brains. But with less discretionary income available these days, its not feasible to abuse fans of classic television with these partial season sets, then change out the incidental music to boot! TV fans, Please, PLEASE resist the temptation to buy this. I LOVE BONANZA, but I refuse to be financially RAPED by the marketing team at CBS Paramount Television anymore.  No other studio is pulling this stunt. We, the consumer have the power to make it stop.  Oh, and Paramount, how about releasing the remaining 3 seasons of \"Have Gun, Will Travel\" before launching another western?  Or do you think half-way is good enough?",

    "reviewText": "Bonanza of course sits at the very cradle of television itself. There really isnt much to say that fans do not already know in regards to the series. First and foremost it was the acting that brought the well rounded scripts to life. Not just the lead stars -- Bonanza had the absolute luxury of dipping into the well of every one of the greatest character, bit, and journeymen actors in the HISTORY of television.. you heard right, in the HISTORY of the medium. After all, great guest stars are what separates the good shows and the classic shows. I dare you to watch even ONE episode and not think to yourself -- wait, wasnt he/she from.... and chances are they were and they were amazing in it too!On a technical level I found the packaging to be handsome, the transfer to be nice, the extras competent (since most shows of this age have NO extras), the price though high is well worth it. A definite buy.In light of today its hard to even comprehend a nightly line up such as Bonanza, the Twilight Zone, and the Andy Griffith Show.. Its also hard to imagine a cast in which it is quite possible that a Michael Landon is the weakest link in the chain.. all I can say is never again. The beauty of true drama has been drained completely out of modern tv and I thank Paramount for helping us all remember when there was a right and a wrong, there was a time to fight, and a time to give thanks.. this show truly is a Bonanza in every sense of the word.PS..

    "reviewText": "Back in the late 50s and 60s when I was a kid growing up, all the major networks had at least 1 quality western and many had multiple such shows. Introduced by NBC in 1959, Bonanza was one of the longest running westerns and was eclipsed in longevity only by CBSs Gunsmoke.  Bonanza was something of a watershed event for NBC.  Billed as the first Western in living color, this was something its direct competitor Gunsmoke did not have until around 1966.Bonanza was the story of the Cartwright family and their Nevada ranch the Ponderosa.  Originally starring Loren Greene as Ben Cartwright, the patriarch of the family, and actors Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker, and Michael Landon as sons Adam, Hoss and Little Joe.  Each week would provide a new adventure with a cast of notable guests, some of which went on to be stars on the big screen.While a number of shows from the golden age of TV were offered on DVD in complete season editions, for some reason Bonanza was long left out.  Often you could get some compilation of the best shows of the series, but never a complete season on DVD.  That is until now.As others have pointed out, the packaging for the first season is nothing to get excited about, but within each DVD are some really nice extras, such as photo galleries, the pilot with alternate endings and original bumpers used to signify commercial breaks.  The quality of the audio and video transfers is also excellent.Considering the age of the material,  video transfers are clean and colors quite beautiful.  As good as the video is, I was probably equally, if not more impressed with sound.  The process of cleaning up sound can be quite difficult with such old material.  To really appreciate what a job Paramount did, look and listen carefully when the commercial bumpers come up.  The bumper and Loren Greenes closing lines on the pilot show were left original and there is an order of magnitude difference in the quality between original material and the DVD transfer.  Paramount deserves kudos for their effort on this one.That said, i was pleased with this offering. Now I wish Paramount would offer the The High Chaparral and Cimarron Strip on complete season and complete series DVD.  These shows along with Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, and Wild Wild West were my favorite shows growing up.",

It has elements of Seinfeld and Drew Carey and lots of political incorrectness. Fans of The Simpsons, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ali G/Borat will probably appreciate the humour.While running Paddys Bar in Philadelphia, this group of 30 year olds? tackles a different social issue in each episode. Issues include underage drinking, gun ownership, abortion etc. Unfortunately, these still young adults are incapable of learning about life without making some big mistakes along the way, and the results are hilarious.

When Danny DeVito comes on board, the show quickly devolves into lots and lots of shouting matches as a substitute for comedy (not DeVitos fault, but more a problem with the writing).  Too bad.
